# TÃ©vari ðŸª¨

(NPM Package) Collection of various small helpers for javascript and typescript based projects, all tested and documented.

In Huichol, TÃ©vari means small rocks. This library is just that, small rocks (helpers) designed to ease the development of javascript or typescript projects.

## Getting Started

**Npm:**

```bash
npm install tevari
```

**Yarn:**

```bash
yarn add tevari
```

Then import TÃ©vari functions wherever needed ðŸ¤“

## Using TÃ©vari ðŸ“–

For each sections (strings, arrays, numbers, ...), there is 2 ways to use tÃ©vari helpers:

- Import the helper object from the desired section:

  ```typescript
  import { StringHelpers } from "tevari";

  // ...

  StringHelpers.plainify("WeÃ¬rd");
  ```

- Import the desired helper method directly:

  ```typescript
  import { stringPlainify } from "tevari";

  // ...

  stringPlainify("WeÃ¬rd");
  ```

  Every direct helper method are prefixed by the name of the section in singular. (ie. `StringHelpers.plainify` <=> `stringPlainify`)
